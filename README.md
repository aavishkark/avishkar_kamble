# Portfolio
This portfolio is a simple, clean space I built to share a bit about myself, my skills, and the projects I've worked on. I wanted something that feels easy to navigate and looks good on any device, whether it's a phone or a desktop. The design is focused on keeping things clear and straightforward, so visitors can quickly get a sense of what I do without distractions. Itâ€™s built using modern web tools and reflects both my technical skills and personal style.
